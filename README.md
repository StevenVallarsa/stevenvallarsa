# Well hello there. You found me! 
### I'm Steve, an aspiring software developer. I rediscovered my passion for coding in 2018 and am gradually taking flight as I: 

- absorb more knowledge
- develop more skills 
- and learn to point myself in the direction where I can make the most positive difference in the world. 

### I have certainly sputtered more than fluttered at times during this difficult journey, but I take these following words to heart:

>#### Life is long. And it isn't a race.
>Steven Levitt -- University of Chicago Economist and co-author of *Freakonomics*

## Elavator Pitch
After careers in graphic design, sign making and manufacturing production, I reignited my long dormant passion for coding. Starting with a few online courses, I ramped up my education by enrolling in a full-time in-person C# .NET bootcamp to level up my skills. I'm now completing a different bootcamp focusing on the front end to balance my skillset as I look to become a full-stack developer. I bring with me a lifetime of diverse problem-solving experiences that makes me an outstanding candidate to fill an entry-level position where I may be nurtured to quickly grow into more junior- and mid-level roles. I'm open to relocation in the American Mid-West and along the Hwy 401 corridor between Windsor, ON and Montr√©al, QC in Canada.
